MediaFile: elegant audio file tagging
=====================================

MediaFile is a simple interface to the metadata tags for many audio file
formats. It wraps `Mutagen`_, a high-quality library for low-level tag
manipulation, with a high-level, format-independent interface for a common set
of tags.
